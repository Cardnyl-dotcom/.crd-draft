Hello Everyone :)

My name is Cardnyl and recently we started some coding projects that aim to make a new type of media player thats only available on the blockchain eco-system.

It's going to be a 3 or 4 part for development and disign but at the moment I want to see if anyone here has any interest in helping with the project or giving feedback to the idea.

Right now it's at a pretty easy part of development, which is designing a new type of audio format thats only available on the blockchain, in order to solve a long standing problem of metadata encryption and music downloading.

Yes I know people could still just record it, but those wont have anywhere near the same value as one thats officially inside of the blockchain. Which is a huge plus :)

Heres the outline of the projecty map that we have at the moment

01. Design new type of Audio Encoding and Encryption that integrates blockchain technology so it runs strictly on the blockchain

In order to do this step there would also be the process of developing a new type of audio encryption and storage. Which would involve something like: Creating a New Audio File Format
To create a new audio file format, we would typically need to:
Learn Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Understanding how audio signals are processed is crucial for developing a new format4.
Define Specifications: Decide on the compression method (lossy vs. lossless), sample rates, bit depth, and other technical parameters.
Develop Encoding/Decoding Algorithms: Create algorithms that can encode audio data into your new format and decode it back for playback.
This process requires expertise in programming and knowledge of audio engineering principles4.

The blockchains algorithm might be enough to encrypt audio in a new enough way. However for this idea to work a new type of digital audio storage has to be developed as well. In order for them to be played and stored on certain types of media players and not the traditional MP3 or WAV players. The media type should not be able to integrate into MP3 or WAV based media players at all, or ever. 
2. Design a new type of Video encoding andf encryption so that it can only run on the blockchain

3. Integrate those two things into a new platform and music player that runs on the blockchain and gives the ability to people to invest in the musicians and artists that they love

This will create new interests in fanbases and new types of investing as well as new levels of participation when it comes to certain releases, watching and listening, and investing as a whole.

What advantage to we have to the rest of the media players and streaming platforms? Well....theyre platforms arent an investment.
